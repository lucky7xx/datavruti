  "story": "DataVruti is a specialist recruitment firm helping global enterprises and Series A+ startups hire top talent in India.\n\nIn 2018, we started building a rocketship but failed. Eventually, we found our calling in helping other leaders build theirs. From Series A+ funded startups to global organizations, we've hired across roles, levels, and geographies.\n\nOur founders, coming from technical and recruitment backgrounds themselves, understood these challenges firsthand. They built DataVruti to be more than a recruitment agencyâ€”we're operators who also recruit, bringing 50+ years of combined experience with deep understanding of the industries we operate in.",
