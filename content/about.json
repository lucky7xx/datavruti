  "story": "DataVruti was founded with a simple observation: hiring data professionals is fundamentally different from hiring other tech roles. The combination of technical depth, domain expertise, and business acumen required makes data roles uniquely challenging to fill.\n\nOur founders, coming from data engineering and analytics backgrounds themselves, understood these challenges firsthand. They built DataVruti to be more than a recruitment agencyâ€”we're a specialized partner that truly understands the data landscape.\n\nToday, we work with startups and enterprises across industries, helping them build world-class data teams. Our success is measured not just in placements, but in the long-term impact our candidates make.",
